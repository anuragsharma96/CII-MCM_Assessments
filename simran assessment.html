<h1> <p> what is a computer and how does it work ? </p> </h1>
<p> computer is a machine and electronic device which uses raw data and gives output. <p/>
<p> there are 5 generations of computer </p>

<th> First Generation (1940-1956)
The period of first generation was 1946-1959. The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit) </th>
<th> second generation computer </th>
<th> The second generation of computers were computers that used transistors instead of vacuum tubes. They were developed in the late 1950s and 1960s. </th>

<th> third generation computer </th>
<th> The third generation of computers were introduced in the 1960s and were the first to resemble modern computers. They were smaller, faster, more reliable, and more affordable than previous generations. </th>

<th>fourth generation computer </th>
<th> The fourth generation of computers were developed between 1971 and 1980. They were characterized by the use of Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits, also known as microprocessors. </th>

<h1><p> components of computer  </p></h1>
<h2> <p>A computer is an electronic device that accepts data, performs operations, displays results, and stores the data or results as needed. It is a combination of hardware and software resources that integrate and provide various functionalities to the user. Hardware is the physical components of a computer, such as a processor, memory devices, monitor, keyboard, etc., while software is a set of programs or instructions that are required by the hardware resources to function properly. </p></h2>
